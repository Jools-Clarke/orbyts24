    "\n",
    "**Batch size** is an important hyperparameter in machine learning that defines the number of **training examples** processed together before the model updates its parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "- During training, data is divided into smaller subsets called **batches**.\n",
    "- Each batch is used to calculate the **loss** and perform a single **gradient update**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Batch Sizes\n",
    "1. **Small Batch (Mini-batch)**: \n",
    "   - Size: Usually between 32 and 512.\n",
    "   - **Pros**: Faster updates, better generalization 🏃.\n",
    "   - **Cons**: More noise in gradients 🚧.\n",
    "2. **Large Batch**: \n",
    "   - Size: Can be thousands of examples.\n",
    "   - **Pros**: More stable gradients, efficient training on larger machines 💻.\n",
    "   - **Cons**: Higher memory usage, and can potentially cause overfitting, where the model has been optimised for only a certain subset of the true data, meaning it will likely perform badly on examples that are not present within the training dataset 📈.\n",
    "3. **Full Batch**: \n",
    "   - All data is processed at once.\n",
    "   - Rarely used due to memory and speed limitations 🐢.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing the Right Batch Size\n",
    "- **Small Batch Sizes**: Often better for noisy datasets and limited hardware resources 🎯.\n",
    "- **Larger Batch Sizes**: Useful for smooth convergence when sufficient computational power is available 💪.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact on Training\n",
    "- Smaller batches add **stochasticity** to training, which is like adding noise and randomness. It helps models generalize better, because within each batch the model is training to a small subset of the data, which is likely not representative of the full distribution. This means that the model needs to learn to cope better with data which is outside of the subset of data which it was trained on.\n",
    "- Larger batches make training more deterministic, which can lead to faster convergence but may reduce generalization.\n",
